        <h1>ALL ABOUT AUSTIN</h1>
        <p id="blurb">You’ve landed on this portfolio for a reason…and that is to see what Austin J. Robinson is all about.
        Well, let this blurb lay it out for you. I decided to move towards learning about web development and software engineering because I wanted to make a change in my career path.
         I wanted to take hold of my future and show that with my adaptability, I would be able to become a skilled software developer and be proud of this career choice. 
         NOW, though I have to do the hard part…actually getting the job. This is where you, hopefully you are a recruiter for a job that you’d love to give me, play a part!
         So this Michigan based developer only has one last thing to say: ‘Hire me please and you won’t regret it, even if I make mistakes..maybe.” :)
